# Black Duck Software CXF Utilities

**The Black Duck Software CXF Utilities library is no longer active - CXF now provides similar in-built functionality, which should be preferred over this library**

See [CXF Debugging and Logging](http://cxf.apache.org/docs/debugging-and-logging.html)

The Black Duck Software CXF Utilities provide facilities for logging CXF message content

## Building
The SDK libraries use [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) for build operations (specifically, the Gradle wrapper, invoked via `gradlew`)

### Importing into an IDE
Instead of using Gradle's plug-ins to generate IDE-specific files, it is assumed that the IDE's Gradle plug-in will be used.

For example, [Eclipse's Gradle Plug-in](https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/gradle-ide-pack) can be used to import the projects into an Eclipse environment

* Changes to APIs must be backwards compatible
* Changes in pull requests should be documented
* If any significant features are added, add tests where possible

## Branches
The repository contains a `master` branch which contains tags for each release and any changes contributed. Releases will be based on what has been merged into the `master` branch
